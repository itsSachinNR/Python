# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This is a personal project where I document my day-to-day progress as I learn Python. I’m following along with the Python course on [Apna College's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ApnaCollegeOfficial), taught by Shradha Khapra.

### Why This Repository?
I created this repository to keep track of my journey, reinforce what I've learned, and provide a structured way to monitor my progress. By updating it daily, I can reflect on what I've accomplished, identify areas I need to review, and gradually build a portfolio of Python knowledge.

### Learning Goals
- **Core Python Concepts**: I've covered basic topics like syntax, data types, and control structures, and plan to build a strong foundation in Python fundamentals.
- **Problem Solving**: I aim to use Python for problem-solving and will focus on applying concepts to coding challenges.
- **Real-world Projects**: After gaining a good grasp of the basics, I’ll work on projects to apply my skills practically.

### Current Status
I've currently completed some foundational concepts in Python. However, I’m taking a brief break from this repository to work on other projects. Once I return, I’ll resume daily updates and continue advancing through new topics.

I look forward to revisiting this repository soon and continuing my progress. Stay tuned!
